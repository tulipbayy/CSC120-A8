Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The `ImplementContract` class represents an implementation of the `Contract` interface in Java. It provides concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the `Contract` interface, fulfilling the requirements.

In addition to the methods listed in the interface, I implemented a constructor for initializing the class attributes (`inventory` and `size`). I also added some auxiliary methods for manipulating the inventory and providing interesting behavior, such as `grab`, `drop`, `examine`, `use`, `walk`, `fly`, `shrink`, `grow`, `rest`, and `undo`. These methods interact with the inventory, perform actions, and provide feedback to the user.

What worked well in this implementation is that it adheres to the contract specified by the interface, providing meaningful implementations for each method. The additional methods add depth and interactivity to the class, making it more interesting and functional.

For someone taking a course involving Java interfaces and classes in the future, my advice would be to thoroughly understand the concept of interfaces and their purpose in Java. Practice implementing interfaces and designing classes that adhere to interface contracts.
